# A TRIP IN THE MOUNTAINS
> We decided to go hiking in the **Alps** :mountain:, hoping to find the *vultures nest*. 
> We had to go off-track to follow their flight and eventually found the nest, in the rock of a cliff-like side of a mountain.
>> In order to get good pictures, we had to ***crawl*** to get closer trying not to draw the attention from the adults.

>>> For informations here is a picture of what's a beautiful vulture : https://cdn.britannica.com/02/162502-050-FEEA94DE/Vulture.jpg

> So now that I realize the purpose of this exercise, I will write some text that makes sense.
> I complained *a lot* about the sun and very hot weather during the summer.
> **I regret it! Please, sun, do come back!!!**
