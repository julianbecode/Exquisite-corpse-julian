# A TRIP IN THE MOUNTAINS
> We decided to go hiking in the **Alps** :mountain:, hoping to find the *vultures nest*. 
> We had to go off-track to follow their flight and eventually found the nest, in the rock of a cliff-like side of a mountain.
>> In order to get good pictures, we had to ***crawl*** to get closer trying not to draw the attention from the adults.
